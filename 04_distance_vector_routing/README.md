# Distance Vector Routing Convergence

## 🧩 Goal
Simulate Distance Vector routing where nodes exchange routing tables until convergence.

## 🧠 Concepts
- RIP-style updates
- Loop detection and count-to-infinity problem

## 🧪 How to Run
```bash
python distance_vector.py
```

## 📈 Extensions
- Add convergence graph
- Compare with Link-State algorithm
